# Casino Games :moneybag:
In this distributed system, users have the ability to connect to any active casino server and search for active games.
Users can then join and play against other users (up to 4 players) for in game currency that is backed up to a database. 

Currently there is only Texas Hold'em but in the future there will be more multiplayer games and singleplayer games
such as slots. 

## Server

* Stores and manages a thread pool of all active games to ensure multi-player.
* Uses a MySQL database for all player information (username, password, wallet[$])
* Parses/Uses JSON data for its messaging system between clients.
* Uses network port 12000 for DatagramSocket(UDP) messages.
